# Game_of_Chess
This repository contains the initial iteration of a simple chess program written in C#. The program is designed with the capability to be extended further, such as by adding more sophisticated gameplay features or improving the AI. Currently, the program includes basic chess rules, player management, and a simple console-based user interface for playing the game.

Features
Basic Chess Rules: Implement the fundamental rules of chess, including piece movements for pawns.
Player Management: Supports two players (white and black) who can take turns to move their pieces across the board.
Console Interface: Includes a method to print the chess board to the console, showing the current game state at any point.
Move Validation: Basic validation of pawn movements, ensuring moves are legal according to chess rules.
Turn Management: Automatically switches between players after each valid move.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

.NET SDK compatible with C# (version 8.0 or higher recommended)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using:
git clone <repo url>
cd chess-program-csharp

Creating a README for your chess program is essential for documenting the purpose, structure, and usage of the software. Here's a simple README template that you can adjust and expand based on the specific details of your C# chess application:
